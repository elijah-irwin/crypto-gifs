My first decentralized app built to gain some experience and a better understanding of the web3 space and technologies. The project allows you to connect via MetaMask and 
send Ethereum to other wallet addresses over the Ropsten testnet. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain through a Solidity smart contract I developed and deployed with Hardhat & Alchemy.
